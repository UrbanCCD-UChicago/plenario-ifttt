# Plenario IFTTT

This is a standalone server that provides an interface between IFTTT and
Plenario in order to enable the development of user friendly applets that
can respond to data reported by live nodes. In order to fulfill this role, 
it must provide an API that has implemented all of IFTTT's [general API requirements](https://platform.ifttt.com/docs/api_reference#general-api-requirements).

## Todos

- [ ] Populate dropdowns for all triggers
- [ ] Implement location based trigger
- [ ] Serve results over HTTPS
